      "question": "What is Giggo?",
      "answer": "Giggo is a platform that connects content creators with brands for paid gigs. Brands post challenges (contests) or deals (collaborations), and creators submit their best content to earn money."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "How do Contests work?",
      "answer": "Brands post a Contest with a prize pool and creative brief. Creators submit their content before the deadline. After the contest ends, brands select winners who receive their share of the prize pool. Multiple winners can be selected based on the contest rules."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "How do Deals work?",
      "answer": "Deals are direct collaborations between brands and creators. Brands set a fixed payment and requirements. Creators submit their content, and once approved by the brand, they receive the full payment. If revisions are needed, brands can request up to 3 redos."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How do I get paid?",
      "answer": "Once you win a contest or have your deal submission approved, payments are processed through our secure payment system. Funds are typically transferred to your connected bank account or payment method within 3-5 business days."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What platforms are supported?",
      "answer": "Giggo currently supports content from TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and YouTube. Brands specify which platforms they want content for in their gig requirements."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Is there a fee to join?",
      "answer": "Joining Giggo is completely free for creators! There are no subscription fees or hidden charges. Brands pay a small platform fee on their campaigns to cover payment processing and platform maintenance."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "How do I increase my chances of winning?",
      "answer": "Read the creative brief carefully and follow all requirements. Create authentic, engaging content that aligns with the brand's vision. Submit early and ensure your content meets the platform-specific requirements (hashtags, mentions, etc.)."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Can I participate in multiple gigs at once?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! You can join as many contests and deals as you'd like. We encourage creators to explore different opportunities and build relationships with multiple brands."
